WAHO has the responsibility of ensuring that standards acceptable to all its Registering Authority Members are established and maintained in the matters of regulations, methods of registration and production of Stud Books. We have a President, an Executive Committee and two elected Consultants to the Executive Committee. Registering Authority Members are each entitled to send two voting delegates to the biennial WAHO General Assemblies. Associate Members may send two non-voting delegates, and Individual Associate Members may attend as observers. We also arrange a World Registrars’ Meeting at each Conference, which has become increasingly important over the years.

The basic objectives of WAHO are, in brief,

“To preserve, improve and maintain the purity of the blood of horses of the Arabian breed and to promote public interest in the science of the breeding of Arabian horses (…);
To promote and facilitate the acquisition and distribution of the knowledge in all Countries of the history, care and treatment of horses of the Arabian breed (…);
To advise and co-ordinate the policies and activities of Members of the Organization (…);
To co-operate with any person or body of persons (…) domiciled throughout the world in an endeavour to promote uniformity in terminology, definitions and procedures relative to the breed of Arabian horses;
To act in a consultative capacity in discussion and negotiation with International, National (…) and other authorities (…) on matters concerning horses of the Arabian breed.”
